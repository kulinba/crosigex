   <section class="story-section normal-section">
        <div class="content">
            <h2>Chapter 1: The First Glimpse (Normal Text Starts Here)</h2>
            <p>This is where the standard scrolling content begins. The text here will **not** disappear, creating a stable reading experience after the initial interactive introduction.</p>
            <p>You can add more paragraphs, images, or data visualizations here. The idea is to have engaging content that progresses the narrative as the user scrolls down.</p>

            <!-- CALLOUT BOX - Will animate in from the left and text will wrap around it -->
            <div class="callout-box" id="myCallout">
                <h3>Special Insight!</h3>
                <p>This is an important note or a call to action that slides in smoothly from the left as you scroll.</p>
                <a href="#" class="callout-button">Learn More</a>
            </div>

            <p>Think about how the New York Times uses text to complement its visual effects – clarity and conciseness are key. This paragraph will flow around the callout box, demonstrating the text wrapping effect. The box will appear to be part of the content, rather than a separate block.</p>
            <p>You can continue adding more text here to fully showcase how the content wraps around the callout box. This technique is excellent for presenting supplementary information, quotes, or interactive elements directly within your main narrative flow. It keeps the reader engaged without forcing them to jump to a new section.</p>

            <h2>Odluke: Deep Dive</h2>
            <p>This section can introduce new elements, perhaps a different background, or trigger new animations via
                JavaScript as it comes into view.</p>
            <p>Consider what visual or textual information you want to reveal next. Each section can build on the last,
                guiding the user through your story.</p>
